Here lay a bunch of stack projects while I was working on the "Book of Monads"
by Alejandro Serrano Mena. This code was written on my stream at

Book can be found on Amazon:

receive no financial incentive for your purchase.

## Notes

I stopped at section 15.2.2 due to difficulty. My mental model for Free and
Freer monads is essentially non-existent and thinking about the performance of
Free and Freer monads is useless without it. Looking at Church encoded version
of Free Monads was beyond my abilities. Not entirely sure how to pick this back
up and really finish the final sections of the book.
