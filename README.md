Book of Monads
---

Here lay a bunch of stack projects while I was working on the "Book of Monads"
by Alejandro Serrano Mena. This code was written on my stream at
https://twitch.tv/chiroptical

Book can be found on Amazon:
https://www.amazon.com/Book-Monads-Alejandro-Serrano-Mena/dp/0578405296. I
receive no financial incentive for your purchase.

## Notes

I stopped at section 15.2.2 due to difficulty. I still don't fully comprehend
Free and Freer Monads (theoretically) and that is impeding my ability to
continue. Looking at Church encoded version of Free Monads was beyond my
abilities. Not entirely sure how to pick this back up and really finish the
last bits of the book.
